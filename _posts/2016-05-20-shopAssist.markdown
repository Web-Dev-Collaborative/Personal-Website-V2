<span>Problem: How can we lessen the language barrier between a customer and the employee?</span>
<p>While I was working at retail one day, a customer who does not speak English fluently approached me trying to ask for something. It took some time but I was able to help that customer. At the same time, it got me thinking, how can I help similar customers communicate better with people who does not speak the same language. With everyone relying on handheld, mobile devices, an app would be the most suitable to lessen the communication barriers. The iOS app uses a speech sythesizer to say certain words/phrases in English that a customer would want to ask based on my experience. The only thing the user needs to do is press a button that best coresponds to what they would want to ask the retail clerk. Each button contains text written in their own language and colour coded for easier use.</p>
