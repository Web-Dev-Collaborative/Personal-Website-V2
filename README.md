# rchung95.github.io
My new personal webpage using Jekyll, HTML, CSS, MaterializeCSS and jQuery. This is the current one up and running at raymondchung.ca. Compared to the previous one, this design is more sleek and highlights my skills and projects better. 

I am not using the Bootstrap framework but instead MaterializeCSS, because it is based Google's Material Design and it is more UX/UI opinionated. I am also using Jekyll in order to reduce repetitive code and loading time.
